## ðŸ“Š Overview of the Experiment

### Objective
To analyze the impact of adding a Flatten layer or Pooling layers (Max and Average) after an LSTM layer on the performance of the model for IMDB sentiment classification.

### Dataset
- **IMDB Dataset**: A binary sentiment classification dataset containing movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

### Methodology
1. Train a baseline LSTM model without any additional layers after the LSTM.
2. Add a **Flatten** layer after the LSTM and evaluate the model.
3. Add a **Global Max Pooling** layer after the LSTM and evaluate the model.
4. Add a **Global Average Pooling** layer after the LSTM and evaluate the model.

### Results Summary
- **Baseline Accuracy**: 77% (without additional layers).
- **LSTM + Flatten**:
  - Accuracy: 86%
  - Improved performance by adding a Flatten layer.
- **LSTM + Global Max Pooling**:
  - Accuracy: 87%
  - Performed slightly better than Flatten.
- **LSTM + Global Average Pooling**:
  - Accuracy: 86%
  - Slightly less effective than Max Pooling.

**Key Insight**:
- Adding a Flatten or Pooling layer improves model performance significantly.
- Among Pooling layers, Max Pooling slightly outperforms Average Pooling.
