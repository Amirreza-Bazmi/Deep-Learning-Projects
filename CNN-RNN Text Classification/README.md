## üìä Overview of the Experiment

### Objective
To develop a hybrid CNN-RNN model for text classification, leveraging the feature extraction capabilities of CNN and the sequence learning power of RNN (LSTM).

### Dataset
- **FA-KES.csv**: A labeled text dataset (e.g., fake news detection). Ensure the dataset path is updated correctly in the notebook.

### Methodology
1. Preprocess text data:
   - Tokenization and sequence padding.
   - Stopword removal and stemming using NLTK.
2. Build and train a CNN-RNN hybrid model:
   - **Embedding Layer**: Word embeddings for representing text data.
   - **Convolutional Layer**: Feature extraction via 1D convolutions.
   - **Max Pooling Layer**: Down-sampling to reduce dimensionality.
   - **LSTM Layer**: Sequential learning for text data.
   - **Dense Layer**: For final classification.
3. Evaluate the model:
   - Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall.
