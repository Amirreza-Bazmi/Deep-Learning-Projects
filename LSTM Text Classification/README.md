## ðŸ“Š Overview of the Experiment

### Objective
To build and evaluate an LSTM-based model for text classification using a labeled dataset. The pipeline includes preprocessing steps and the use of custom metrics for a more detailed performance assessment.

### Dataset
- **FA-KES.csv**: A text dataset for classification tasks. (Ensure the dataset path is updated correctly in the notebook).

### Methodology
1. Preprocess text data:
   - Tokenization and sequence padding.
   - Stopword removal and stemming using NLTK.
2. Build and train an LSTM model with:
   - Embedding layer for word representation.
   - LSTM layer for capturing sequential patterns.
   - Dense layers for classification.
3. Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
